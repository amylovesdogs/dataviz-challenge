## Pymaceuticals, Inc. Capomulin Drug Study

pymaceuticals.ipynb analyzes the study results of Pymaceuticals' new drug, Capomulin, a treatment for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The code prepares and cleans the test data and produces the following information, including charts/graphs where appropriate.

* The mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume per Drug Regimen.

* The total number of time points for all mice tested for each drug regimen throughout the study.

* The distribution of female versus male mice in the study.

* The distribution of the final tumor volume for all the mice recieving the four most promisting treatments: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Determine if there are any outliers.

* The correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment.

## Analysis

* Capomulin has the smallest average tumor size of all competing SCC regimens except Ramicane. 
* There was a less than 1% difference between trials completed by Capomulin and Ramicane. Campomulin completed 18% more than Ketapril, the third highest at trial completions.
* Percentage of timepoints completed by gender is approximately the same gender percentages as in test subjects. Capomulin is equally effective for both male and female mice.
* The Capomulin trial results showed comparatively low variance and no outliers.
* The correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor volume is strong at 0.84. Weight must be taken into consideration when comparing tumor sizes.
 
## Conclusion
 
Capolin would make Pymaceuticals, Inc. competitive with the market leader, Ramicane, in terms of efficacy against Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
